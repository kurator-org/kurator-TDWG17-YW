This workflow:
- creates a given directory as a workspace
- downloads a given Darwin Core Archive from a URL
- extracts the core file of a Darwin Core Archive to a tab-separated text file
- streams the core file as records
- adds a key/value pair isMarine,true to records appearing to contain marine data
- splits the stream, one branch accepting isMarine=true the other rejecting it.
- TODO: lookup in WoRMS on one stream, look up in GBIF on the other
- recombines the streams into a csv file
- wraps up the workflow
Example command-line usage:
kurator -f dwca_branching_taxon_lookup.yaml
-p workspace=./dwca_geography_assessor_workspace
-p inputfile=../data/test_branching_wf.txt
-l DEBUG (optional)
Requires:
jython pip install requests
jython pip install python-dwca-reader
jython pip install py
jython pip install unicodecsv
jython pip install unidecode

Definitions of the Workflow and actors
## The named workflow ###
Actors invoked in the workflow. Every actor that will be invoked must be on this
list. Though the order does not matter, it is helpful to keep the list in more
or less the order in which they'll be invoked, for clarity.
Each parameter defined here enters the workflow from the command line and is
delivered in the options dictionary of the specified actor.
Accept a parameter called workspace from the command line.
Set the workspace in the options dictionary of MakeWorkspace from the value of
the workspace parameter given on the command line.
Set the inputfile in the options dictionary of the Darwinize actor from the
value of the inputfile parameter given on the command line.
Accept a parameter called format from the command line.
Set the format in the options dictionary of Darwinize from the value
of the format parameter given on the command line.
Accept a parameter called namespace from the command line.
Set the namespace in the options dictionary of Darwinize from the value
of the format parameter given on the command line.
@BEGIN BranchingWorkflow
@PARAM InputFilePath
@IN DarwinCoreFile @URI file:packages/kurator_branching/data/kurator_sample_data_v2.txt
Inline python actor to make a workspace on the fly to use for writing temporary
if one is not supplied in the workflow-defined parameters. It creates a unique
workspace if a workspace location is not explicitly provided, or if the provided
one does not exist.
@BEGIN Setup

of options.
